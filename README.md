# Combinatories
 Working on some math problems related to combinatories and probabilities.

The prisoners problem: 
A bunch of numbered prisoners is asked to individually look for its number inside several boxes, as well numbered, which contain a card from a deck.
They can search in up to half of the number of prisoners boxes.
The most valuable strategy is that they first search in its own number box.
In case it does not match its number they should go next to the box with the number of the card they just look at.
Doing this increases the probabilities up to roughly 35% with 10 prisoners.
